# Web Hosting and Domain Name
## Domain Name
- A domain name is the unique address of your website on the internet (e.g. www.joseh.com).
- It serves as your website’s identity, making it easy for users to find you online. 
- Choosing a domain name that reflects your brand, business, or purpose is essential. You can register a domain through providers like GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Google Domains.
## Web Hosting
- Web hosting is a service that allows you to store your website’s files, databases, and content on a server, making it accessible to users online.
- A hosting provider ensures your website runs smoothly, remains secure, and loads quickly.
- Popular hosting providers include Bluehost, SiteGround, and Hostinger.

## Security Concerns and Protection
# Data security
- Use SSL/TLS encryption (HTTPS) to secure data transmission.
- Store passwords securely using hashing and salting.
# Malware Prevention
- Install firewalls and antivirus software to detect and block threats.
- Perform regular security scans to identify vulnerabilities.
- Restrict and scan file uploads to prevent malicious code execution.
# Regular Updates
- Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
- Use npm, pip, composer, etc., to keep libraries updated.


## Additional Considerations
# Cross-Browser Compatibility
- Different browsers apply default styles. Reset or normalize styles help maintain consistency.
- Use tools like BrowserStack or Lambdatest to test your site on different browsers.
# Accessibility
- Use Semantic HTML which improve screen reader compatibility
-  Enable keyboard navigation to ensure users can navigate without a mouse
# Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
- Use meta tags help search engines understand your page content.
