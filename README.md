#Web Hosting and Domain Name
Domain Name
A domain name is the unique address of your website on the internet (e.g., www.yourwebsite.com). It serves as your websiteâ€™s identity, making it easy for users to find you online. Choosing a domain name that reflects your brand, business, or purpose is essential. You can register a domain through providers like GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Google Domains.
